Technical:
  -Randomly generates the 7x10 map with grass, rocks and bamboo.
  -Coded in a very ineficcient way.
  -Coded using eval().

To Developers:
  The inefficiency of the code makes it very difficult to know what's going on and very difficult to add custom items etc.
  Please do not tell me ways to make it more efficient. I know ways to do it, but I am not going to change anything anymore.
  Please don't tell me not to use eval(), I know this. It will not change.
  
Have fun!
